        <h2>What are those wonderful critters?</h2>
        <p>Jumping spiders are the largest group of spiders on Earth, with over 6,200 species. They primarily inhabit tropical forests, but are found in a variety of habitats all over the world, with the exception of the North and South poles. While named for their impressive jumping ability, they also have remarkable vision, thanks to their two pairs of eyes. From unusual courtship dances to their ability to be trained to jump on command, discover the most fascinating facts about the jumping spider.</p>

        <h2>Are they dangerous to humans?</h2>
        <p>Jumping spiders are not dangerous to humans, even if you get bitten by one.

            Typically, a jumping spider will only bite when it's being crushed or threatened. According to the University of California Davis, these bites are considered less severe than a bee sting, and may result in a small, mosquito-bite-sized welt (that is, if you have any symptoms at all).
            
            However, if you have an allergy to jumping spider venom — or if the spider that bites you is not a jumping spider after all — these bites can cause health concerns.</p>

        <h2>How do I identify a Jumping Spider?</h2>
        <p>The adult body of these spiders is only about 3/4 of an inch long. Unlike common house spiders and most other spiders, jumping spiders have short legs. Their side and back legs are typically shorter and thinner than their two front legs.

            Like most other spiders, these spiders have eight eyes. They have two larger eyes in the middle with eyes on both sides that are smaller. Their eyes form a U-shape, rather than a straight line. While they have strong eyesight during the day, they don't have good night vision.
            
            If the alignment of their eyes didn't give them away, the color might help you determine if it's a jumping spider. Like most spiders, jumping spiders come in many different colors, ranging from darker shades of black, brown, or gray, to lighter shades, like tan. What makes them unique is their bright, distinctive markings in various colors, such as red, green, yellow, blue, or white.
            
            Jumping spiders have hairy bodies, similar to wolf spiders. The hairs on a jumping spider usually have an iridescent shine to them. This can make these spiders, such as emerald jumping spiders, easy to spot, despite their small size. Some jumping spiders are covered in bright scales rather than iridescent hair.</p>

        <h2>Do they make as good pets?</h2>
        <p>Spiders have earned a bad reputation for being creepy and crawly. But they can actually make really fun and interesting pets. The jumping spider is a good bet. It is not considered dangerous, and it can entertain you with its spectacular hopping skills.</p>
