        <p>
            A jumping spider is the largest family of spiders known for its amazing sense of eyesight. Living up to its name, it is capable of jumping or propelling itself as far as 50 times its body length.
            Because of this ability, the jumping spider doesn't need to spin silk webs to trap its prey. Jumping spiders are the most distinguishable spiders due to their appearance.
            Aside from making them adorable, their physical attributes also aid in their ability to hunt and survive. Amazingly, these spiders can also be kept as pets! 
            There are over 5,000 species of jumping spiders which comprises around 13 percent of all spiders worldwide.

        <h2>Are they dangerous to humans?</h2>
        <p>
            Jumping spiders are not seen as dangerous to humans.
            Typically, a jumping spider will only bite when it's being crushed or threatened.
            According to the University of California Davis, these bites are considered less severe than a bee sting, and may result in a small, mosquito-bite-sized welt (that is, if you have any symptoms at all).
        </p>
        <h4>However, if you have an allergy to jumping spider venom — or if the spider that bites you is not a jumping spider after all — these bites can cause health concerns. In such cases, we strongly recommend you to go to the doctor or call the ambulance.</h4>

        <h2>How do I identify a Jumping Spider?</h2>
        <p>
            The adult body of these spiders is only about 3/4 of an inch long. 
            Unlike common house spiders and most other spiders, jumping spiders have short legs. 
            Their side and back legs are typically shorter and thinner than their two front legs.
            Like most other spiders, these spiders have eight eyes. They have two larger eyes in the middle with eyes on both sides that are smaller. 
            Their eyes form a U-shape, rather than a straight line. While they have strong eyesight during the day, they don't have good night vision.
            If the alignment of their eyes didn't give them away, the color might help you determine if it's a jumping spider. Like most spiders, jumping spiders come in many different colors, ranging from darker shades of black, brown, or gray, to lighter shades, like tan.
            What makes them unique is their bright, distinctive markings in various colors, such as red, green, yellow, blue, or white.
            Jumping spiders have hairy bodies, similar to wolf spiders. The hairs on a jumping spider usually have an iridescent shine to them. 
            This can make these spiders, such as emerald jumping spiders, easy to spot, despite their small size. Some jumping spiders are covered in bright scales rather than iridescent hair.

        <h2>Do they make as good pets?</h2>
        <p>
            Spiders have earned a bad reputation for being creepy and crawly. But they can actually make really fun and interesting pets. 
           The jumping spider is a good bet. It is not considered dangerous, and it can entertain you with its spectacular hopping skills. Click <a href="pet-care.html">here</a> to visit our Pet Care section and learn more about taking care of a pet spider!
