                    Spiders are one of the easiest pets to maintain. It is even cheaper if you catch one on your own because, unlike their counterparts from particular climates, you won't need to provide heat or have the right humidity level. 
                    They are hardy and adapt well to any environment, and you are good to go as long as you provide a cozy enclosure and their daily needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since jumping spiders are tiny pets, you won't need to go all out on housing. 
                    You can set aside adequate space for them in a small terrarium, jar, or tank and place it on a tabletop. 
                    These spiders are adventurous and may need a high enclosure, but they will not take up much room. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will never get bored with these pets around because all spiders are pretty fascinating. 
                    From their web building, hunting, and adorable faces, it will be fun to take pictures or stare at them. 
                    You will also learn more about a spider's daily life from them as you spend more time together.

                    The most significant concern among first-time spider owners is that they are afraid of spider bites and venom. 
                    Jumping spiders, like most animals, have to defend themselves when they believe that their lives are in danger. 
                    Therefore, if you handle them roughly, they may bite as a defense mechanism. 
                    These bites can be painful, lead to swelling, and irritation, and, maybe severe, especially if you are allergic. 
                    The good news is, they may ease into your hold if you are calm when handling them. 
                    Otherwise, you can wear gloves and other protective gear when holding them for the first time.
                </li>

                    Generally, jumping spiders have a short lifespan. They may only work for you if you are not very keen on a lifetime companion. 
                    If you take great care of them and all factors stay constant, the females may reach three years. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most spiders love to explore, and the jumping species are infamous for that, thanks to their flight skill. 
                    Therefore, it is advisable to be extra careful when handling them because they can easily escape and get hurt in the process, especially when you have other pets in the house.
