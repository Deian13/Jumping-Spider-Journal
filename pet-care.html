        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Create a safe environment. Jumping spiders can thrive in a variety of environments. In order to make sure they have room to jump, try to choose a container that is at least a cubic foot in size. 
            Glass or plastic terrariums work well.
            The enclosure should have good ventilation to prevent stagnated air and mould growth. 
            Ventilation holes should be small enough for the spider not to be able to take advantage of them and escape. 
            On the other hand, holes have to be big enough to allow airflow.
            Jumping spiders don't spin webs, but they do enjoy resting in little nests. Make sure to add some decorations for the spider to explore. 
            For example, a few sticks or pieces of cork bark with some fake plants should be enough to provide the spider with a variety of terrains to climb on. 
            Use materials non-susceptible to mould. 
            As a substrate, potting soil should work perfectly.
            Keep the cage out of direct sunlight. You don't want your spider to overheat.

                <p>
                    Jumping spiders are agile hunters and will be readily feeding on following feeder insects: Crickets, flies, roaches, meal worms, wax worms, moths etc.
                    You can either buy them from the pet store, or try to catch them yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of feeding frequency, it ultimately depends on your individual spider. Some will eat every single day, while others may take frequent, week-long breaks from eating. 
                    The average jumping spider eats every 2 to 3 days, while spiderlings eat more frequently at once every day or every other day.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 id="water">Water</h2>
                <p>
                    Supply your jumping spider with a water bowl. Place a small dish of water in your jumping spider's enclosure. 
                    Small bottle caps are the most common bowl, but you can get creative here. This bowl offers a direct water source for drinking, in addition to contributing towards the humidity of the enclosure.
                    How often should I give my jumping spider water?
                    Spiders need very small droplets of water only. If you have a misting bottle, one small squirt of water mist on the side of its cage every few days should be plenty. 
                    Otherwise, just drip a few drops on the side of the cage. No puddles, or else your spider could drown.
                </p>

                <h2 id="handling">Handling a jumping Spider</h2>
                <p>There are two ways you can approach handling. Guiding spider to your hand with brush/straw or tricking spider it into jumping on your hand. 
                    Both of the ways will likely to work well when executed with patience.
                    To guide the spider to your hand you need to place your palm in front of spider, keep an eye on its reactions and gently poke spider abdomen to make it walk onto your hand.
                    To trick jumping spider into going to your hand, wait until spider gets to the highest spot and starts waving front legs. At this point offer your hand as a place to jump to. 
                    Place it on the same elevation as the spider is at this point but about 3cm (1 inch) away. 
                    It will interest and trigger spider to jump. Sometimes, once spider is on your hand, it will do a double-take and jump back. 
                    Be patient and let spider do it a few times until it is comfortable with unusual smells human hands have.
                    Once the spider is on your hand, place your other hand in front of the spider, so when it moves it is going from one hand to another. 
                    It can take a couple of minutes for a spider to calm down. However once it does, you know it feels safe.
                    The spider will use to interaction if handled correctly and regularly. If all done right, it will take less and less time for the spider to feel safe when out of its enclosure.
                    Individual spider personalities can vary. While some of them are predisposed to interactions, others can be less friendly and prefer not to be handled.</p>

                    Spiders are one of the easiest pets to maintain. It is even cheaper if you catch one on your own because, unlike their counterparts from particular climates, you won't need to provide heat or have the right humidity level. 
                    They are hardy and adapt well to any environment, and you are good to go as long as you provide a cozy enclosure and their daily needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since jumping spiders are tiny pets, you won't need to go all out on housing. 
                    You can set aside adequate space for them in a small terrarium, jar, or tank and place it on a tabletop. 
                    These spiders are adventurous and may need a high enclosure, but they will not take up much room. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will never get bored with these pets around because all spiders are pretty fascinating. 
                    From their web building, hunting, and adorable faces, it will be fun to take pictures or stare at them. 
                    You will also learn more about a spider's daily life from them as you spend more time together.

                <li>
                    The most significant concern among first-time spider owners is that they are afraid of spider bites and venom. 
                    Jumping spiders, like most animals, have to defend themselves when they believe that their lives are in danger. 
                    Therefore, if you handle them roughly, they may bite as a defense mechanism. 
                    These bites can be painful, lead to swelling, and irritation, and, maybe severe, especially if you are allergic. 
                    The good news is, they may ease into your hold if you are calm when handling them. 
                    Otherwise, you can wear gloves and other protective gear when holding them for the first time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generally, jumping spiders have a short lifespan. They may only work for you if you are not very keen on a lifetime companion. 
                    If you take great care of them and all factors stay constant, the females may reach three years. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most spiders love to explore, and the jumping species are infamous for that, thanks to their flight skill. 
                    Therefore, it is advisable to be extra careful when handling them because they can easily escape and get hurt in the process, especially when you have other pets in the house.
